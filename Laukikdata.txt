Background on Radiation and Photodynamic Therapies for Cancer Treatment

External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) involves the use of a machine to direct radiation precisely at a cancerous site. As a local treatment, it targets only the specific part of the body affected by cancer. For instance, a patient with lung cancer will receive radiation directed solely at the chest area. EBRT is widely used to treat various cancers, offering a non-invasive approach to controlling tumor growth. The integration of AI-based tools enhances EBRT by optimizing beam placement, improving dose distribution, and reducing unintended exposure to healthy tissues.

3-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT)3D Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) is an advanced form of EBRT that incorporates 3D treatment planning. By using CT imaging instead of traditional X-rays, 3DCRT allows for more accurate tumor localization and visualization of surrounding critical normal organs. This facilitates optimal beam placement and effective shielding, reducing damage to healthy tissues. AI enhances 3DCRT by automating the delineation of tumor volumes, predicting dose responses, and refining treatment plans for better outcomes.

Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT)Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) integrates on-board imaging and advanced technologies like the MR-Linac to enhance the precision of radiation delivery. IGRT addresses geometrical uncertainties caused by organ motion, treatment response, and patient setup variations. AI-driven image processing enables real-time corrections, ensuring accurate targeting despite anatomical changes. This reduces setup margins and minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissues, significantly improving treatment safety.

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat a variety of cancers, including leukemia, carcinomas, and precancerous lesions. PDT involves the administration of photosensitizing drugs that selectively accumulate in tumor tissues. Upon exposure to non-thermal visible light of a specific wavelength, these drugs activate a photodynamic reaction that generates highly reactive singlet oxygen species, leading to cancer cell death. AI supports PDT by optimizing light dose distribution, enhancing imaging for precise targeting, and predicting treatment responses based on patient-specific data.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Radiation Oncology (RO) and Interventional Radiotherapy (IRT)AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing radiation therapy by improving clinical decision support systems (DSS), data mining, advanced imaging analysis, and automating repetitive tasks. It optimizes the entire treatment workflow, including patient consultation, target volume delineation, treatment planning, and delivery. AI contributes to better clinical outcomes through predictive models, reducing healthcare costs, improving treatment quality assurance, and enhancing patient care quality.

Applications of AI in Radiation Therapy:

Patient Consultation: AI personalizes treatment plans, improves patient education about expected toxicities, and guides treatment selection.

Delineation: AI-driven auto-segmentation enhances accuracy in tumor contouring, saving time and ensuring consistency.

Treatment Planning: AI optimizes radiation treatment plans using inverse planning algorithms and supports plan comparisons (e.g., photon vs. proton therapy).

Motion Management: AI improves precision in tracking tumor and organ motion, reducing unnecessary radiation exposure.

Adaptive Radiotherapy: AI allows real-time adjustments during treatment, accounting for anatomical changes.

AI in Interventional Radiotherapy (IRT/Brachytherapy):AI enhances the selection of optimal applicator placement, minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissues, and predicts treatment responses. Machine learning models optimize radiation doses, improving treatment outcomes while minimizing toxicity. AI also integrates with imaging technologies (CT, MRI, PET) to enhance image-guided IRT (IG-IRT).

Advanced AI Techniques in Radiation Therapy:

Knowledge-Based Planning: AI leverages big data to improve treatment planning efficiency and accuracy.

Combination with Immunotherapy: AI-supported radiation therapy shows potential benefits when combined with immunotherapy, enhancing anti-tumor responses.

Error Detection and Cost Reduction: AI reduces human errors and repetitive tasks, lowering treatment costs and improving efficiency.
