Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy

1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized healthcare, with radiotherapy being one of the most impacted fields. AI enhances the accuracy, efficiency, and personalization of cancer treatment through advanced data analysis, automation, and predictive modeling. Radiotherapy involves precise targeting of malignant cells while sparing healthy tissues, and AI significantly contributes to optimizing this balance. According to a 2023 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), AI-based technologies have shown up to a 30% improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a 25% reduction in treatment planning time across various oncology centers globally.

2. Background on Radiation and Photodynamic Therapies for Cancer Treatment

External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT):EBRT involves the use of a machine to direct radiation precisely at a cancerous site. As a local treatment, it targets only the specific part of the body affected by cancer. For instance, a patient with lung cancer will receive radiation directed solely at the chest area. EBRT is widely used to treat various cancers, offering a non-invasive approach to controlling tumor growth. The integration of AI-based tools enhances EBRT by optimizing beam placement, improving dose distribution, and reducing unintended exposure to healthy tissues.

3-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT):3DCRT is an advanced form of EBRT that incorporates 3D treatment planning. By using CT imaging instead of traditional X-rays, 3DCRT allows for more accurate tumor localization and visualization of surrounding critical normal organs. This facilitates optimal beam placement and effective shielding, reducing damage to healthy tissues. AI enhances 3DCRT by automating the delineation of tumor volumes, predicting dose responses, and refining treatment plans for better outcomes.

Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT):IGRT integrates on-board imaging and advanced technologies like the MR-Linac to enhance the precision of radiation delivery. IGRT addresses geometrical uncertainties caused by organ motion, treatment response, and patient setup variations. AI-driven image processing enables real-time corrections, ensuring accurate targeting despite anatomical changes. This reduces setup margins and minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissues, significantly improving treatment safety.

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT):PDT is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat a variety of cancers, including leukemia, carcinomas, and precancerous lesions. PDT involves the administration of photosensitizing drugs that selectively accumulate in tumor tissues. Upon exposure to non-thermal visible light of a specific wavelength, these drugs activate a photodynamic reaction that generates highly reactive singlet oxygen species, leading to cancer cell death. AI supports PDT by optimizing light dose distribution, enhancing imaging for precise targeting, and predicting treatment responses based on patient-specific data.
