Objective of the Invention
The primary objective of this invention is to develop an AI-powered precision oncology model that maximizes combination chemotherapy and targeted radiation therapy for improved cancer treatment results. This system will seek to marry artificial intelligence with personalized medicine to enhance treatment precision, responsiveness, and reliability while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional approaches. Being a first-time model development, the invention will focus on the following primary areas:
1.
Detailed Data Representation: For the purpose of ensuring robust and impartial AI performance, the model will utilize diverse datasets ranging from patient demographics and genetics to cancer type and stage, medical history, treatment response, and tumor information. This first step ensures the model is trained on representative data for guaranteed results.
2.
Seamless System Integration: The invention will utilize friendly API frameworks to support seamless integration with current hospital information systems. This ensures data continuity, eliminates silos, and allows healthcare practitioners to view crucial patient information in real-time for improved decision-making.
3.
Optimized Combination Chemotherapy: Drawing from sophisticated algorithms, the model will learn from previous treatment data to recommend the best drug combinations, dosages, and administration schedules. This approach seeks to minimize side effects and improve treatment efficacy through personalized strategies.
4.
Optimization of Targeted Radiation Therapy: The model will utilize machine learning algorithms to calculate optimal doses of radiation, predict tissue response, and minimize damage to healthy cells. This ensures safer and more efficient radiation therapy.
5.
Stringent Testing and Validation: For building confidence in the usability of the model in real-world settings, the invention will undergo systematic testing and validation in controlled environments. This step ensures the model's reliability and efficacy before widespread clinical use.
6. Increased Generalizability of the Model: With the integration of techniques such as dropout and data augmentation, the model will not overfit and will be able to generalize to new, unseen data. This will provide flexibility across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.
7. Improved Interpretability: The system will integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide clear, interpretable insights into the AI's decision-making process. This encourages clinicians and healthcare professionals to trust and accept the AI.
8. Cost-Effectiveness: The model will reduce wastage of drugs, shorten hospital stays, reduce rehabilitation costs, and improve resource utilization, making cancer care more cost-effective and affordable.
