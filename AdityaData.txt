A.	PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY THE INVENTION:  
The primary problem addressed by the invention is the lack of personalized adaptability and real-time optimization in prosthetic implants, which often results in limited functionality, discomfort, and reduced quality of life for individuals with limb loss or impairment. Traditional prosthetics do not dynamically interact with the user's biological tissues and fail to account for the unique anatomical and biomechanical variations of each patient. As a result, these devices struggle to provide seamless integration with the human body, leading to issues such as poor fitting, inefficient movement, reduced comfort, and the need for frequent manual adjustments.
This invention tackles the challenge by introducing AI-powered digital twins, which create virtual models of a patient’s anatomy. These models enable real-time monitoring and predictive analysis of prosthetic performance, ensuring continuous optimization based on sensor data and machine learning. By addressing biomechanical compatibility, patient-specific customization, and autonomous adaptability, the invention enhances prosthetic functionality, improves patient outcomes, and increases the overall quality of life for users.

The system is designed to detect and predict potential issues, such as misalignment or material stress, allowing for automatic adjustments to the prosthetic's movement, fit, and interaction with biological tissues without manual intervention.

2. To Utilize Machine Learning Algorithms for Personalized Prosthetic Optimization:  
   The invention incorporates machine learning algorithms that analyse patient-specific data, including gait analysis, muscle engagement, and usage patterns. The system leverages this data to dynamically optimize the prosthetic’s performance and adapt its behaviour to suit the patient’s evolving biomechanical needs, ensuring maximum efficiency, comfort, and functionality.

3. To Enhance Biomechanical Compatibility through Sensor-Based Feedback Loops:  
   The system integrates a variety of sensors to capture real-time biomechanical feedback from the prosthetic interface, including load distribution, joint angles, and muscle activity. This data is processed to ensure that the prosthetic device operates in harmony with the patient’s natural movements, providing improved comfort and reducing the risk of injury caused by misalignment or unnatural movement patterns.

4. To Facilitate Material Innovation and Prosthetic Design through Predictive Analytics:

D.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION:  
System Design for AI-Powered Digital Twins in Prosthetic Implants
The system design for integrating AI-powered digital twins in prosthetic implants is a multi-layered, interconnected architecture that combines advanced data acquisition, processing, and feedback mechanisms. The core components include sensor integration, data management systems, SCADA for real-time control, machine learning models for predictive analysis, and user interaction feedback for continuous improvement. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the system design and its analytical components. The architecture of the AI-powered digital twin system comprises five key layers:
Sensing Layer

This layer involves embedding a range of sensors within the prosthetic device to collect real-time data on its interaction with the human skeletal system and surrounding tissues. The types of sensors used include:
- Pressure Sensors: Monitor the distribution of pressure exerted by the prosthetic on residual limbs.
- Motion Sensors (IMU – Inertial Measurement Unit) : Track the kinematic movement of the prosthetic, including velocity, acceleration, and angular position.
- Temperature Sensors: Measure the heat generated due to prosthetic friction or inflammation in biological tissues.
- Biosensors: Measure biological factors such as muscle activity (electromyography or EMG) and skin response for more detailed insights into user adaptation and interaction.
-Data Frequency and Sampling Rate Considerations:
The data from these sensors are sampled at high frequencies (in the range of 100–500 Hz) to ensure real-time responsiveness and precision in capturing prosthetic interactions. Adaptive sampling algorithms can be used to dynamically adjust the sampling rates based on user activity (e.g., higher rates during movement, lower rates during rest).
Data Acquisition and Transmission Layer

The data acquired from sensors must be efficiently transmitted to the computational resources for processing, including both cloud-based and edge computing options:

- Wired/Wireless Data Transmission:  Wireless technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, or 5G enable seamless, low-latency communication between the prosthetic and the SCADA system.
- Edge Computing: In cases where real-time responsiveness is critical (e.g., immediate feedback on malfunctions), edge computing platforms can process the data locally before sending it to the cloud for more extensive analysis.
- Cloud Integration: Cloud platforms offer scalable resources for long-term data storage and higher-level analytics (e.g., training machine learning models).

Digital Twin Core
The digital twin core is the heart of the system, responsible for creating a virtual replica of the patient's anatomy and prosthetic interaction. This core consists of two major subsystems:
3D Modelling and Simulation Subsystem
- Anatomical Model Creation: 3D models of the patient’s limb and surrounding skeletal structure are created based on imaging data (MRI, CT scans). These models are then integrated into the digital twin environment to simulate real-time prosthetic interaction.
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA): FEA is used to simulate the stress, strain, and pressure distribution between the prosthetic and biological tissues. This helps assess biomechanical compatibility and optimize prosthetic design.
- Kinematic and Dynamic Analysis: This subsystem performs simulations of how the prosthetic will move in conjunction with the skeletal structure, predicting outcomes such as energy efficiency and natural movement patterns.

AI and Machine Learning Subsystem
This subsystem processes real-time data through AI and machine learning techniques, providing predictive insights and optimizing prosthetic function.
- Predictive Maintenance: Machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVM) or deep learning neural networks, are trained on historical sensor data to predict prosthetic wear or malfunction. For example, models can forecast when components like joints or hinges may fail due to fatigue or high stress.
- Adaptive Learning Algorithms: Algorithms are designed to learn from user feedback, continuously adjusting the interaction between the prosthetic and biological tissues to enhance comfort and functionality. Reinforcement learning models can adapt to user movements and environmental conditions, ensuring long-term adaptability.
- Personalization: User-specific parameters, such as muscle strength, gait patterns, and prosthetic alignment, are continuously adjusted to ensure optimal performance and comfort. Neural networks may optimize these parameters in real time, reducing any discomfort or inefficiency.

- Proactive Adjustments: Based on the feedback loop, SCADA can automatically implement minor adjustments (e.g., adjusting pressure distribution) or recommend rehabilitation strategies.

Material and Design Optimization
The digital twin system enables advanced simulations and testing to optimize prosthetic material and design.

- Material Testing via Digital Twins: Using simulations, the system can test different materials for the prosthetic, assessing their biocompatibility, durability, and performance under stress. For example, Carbon Fiber composites or lightweight polymers may be evaluated for their interaction with bone and muscle tissue.
- Iterative Design Process : Simulation results feed into the prosthetic design process, where iterative improvements are made based on the digital twin’s recommendations. Finite element models can simulate various stress conditions (walking, running, standing) to ensure long-term durability.
